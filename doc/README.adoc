Name
----

hcs - Small command-line tool to control a Voltcraft PPS-11360 Programmable DC Power Supply.

Synopsys
--------

hcs ['command']

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This manual page explains the *hcs* program. The *hcs* program provides basic control for the
Programmable DC Power Supply.

The tool allows you to retrieve status from the power supply, set voltage, current and output state.

COMMANDS
--------
Multiple commands can be specified in one go.

 * *auto*
Auto connect to first detected power supply.

 * *auto <id>*
Auto connect to detected power supply with <id>.

 * *list*
List autodetected power supplies.

 * *status*
Report status from the power supply. (Current voltage, current and active limiter)

 * *voltage*
Read the output voltage.

 * *voltage <value>*:
Set the output voltage (in Volts).

 * *current*
Read the output current limit.

 * *current <value>*:
Set the output current limiter (in Amps).

 * *off*
Turn the output off.

 * *on*
Turn the output on.
 
 * *mode*
Get the mode the power supply is currently in, this can be 'CC' (Control Current), 'CV' (Control
Voltage) and 'Off' (output off).

 * *ocp*
Get the level the Over current protection will kick in.

 * *ocp <value>*
Set the level the Over current protection will kick in.

 * *ovp*
Get the level the Over voltage protection will kick in.

 * *ovp <value>*
Set the level the Over voltage protection will kick in.

 * *interactive*
Go into interactive mode.

EXAMPLES
--------

   hcs voltage 5 output 1.3 status

Set the output voltage to 5Volts, the output current limit to 1.3Amps and report the current status.
